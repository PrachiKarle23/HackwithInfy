Question 2:
There are three piles of stones. The first pile contains a stones, the second pile contains b stones and the third pile contains c stones. You must choose one of the piles
and split the stones from it to the other two piles; specifically, if the chosen pile initially contained s stones, you should choose an integer k (0≤k≤s), move k stones 
from the chosen pile onto one of the remaining two piles and s−k stones onto the other remaining pile. Determine if it is possible for the two remaining piles (in any order) 
to contain x stones and y stones respectively after performing this action.
