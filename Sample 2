There is a battle between heroes and villains going on. You have M heroes, all of them have the same health H. There are N villains, health of the ith villain is Vi. 
When a hero, with health H battles a villain with health Vi, one of the three scenarios can happen: if H > Vi: The villain is defeated and the health of the hero is
decreased by Vi if H Vi: The villain wins, his health is not affected and the hero is no longer able to fight. if H-Vic Both of them are considered defeated and neither 
can fight. The heroes start fighting villains one by one in the same order, first villain 1 then villain 2 and so on. It is might be possible that before defeating all 
the villains, all the heroes are defeated. Therefore, to ensure the victory of the heroes, you want to remove some villains. from the front. Your task is to find the 
minimum number of villains you need to remove from the front such that the victory of the heroes is guaranteed. Note: If in the last battle, both the hero and villain are 
defeated and no more heroes or villains remain, it would still be considered a victory since all the villains are defeated. Parameters: N-INTEGER The first line contains an 
integer, N, denoting the number of villains N-1-2*10^5 M-INTEGER The next line contains an integer, M, denoting the number of heroes M12*10^5 H-INTEGER The next line 
contains an integer, H, denoting the health of each of the heroes H=1->10^9 array: INTEGER ARRAY Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 ≤ i < N) contains an integer 
describing the health of each of the villains. array1->10/9
